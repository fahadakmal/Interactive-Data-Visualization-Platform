# Satisfaction Questionnaire Removal - Summary

## Date: 2025-10-12

## Problem

The experiment had **two post-block satisfaction questionnaires** that were unnecessary for the **between-subjects design**:
- After completing tasks, participants were asked two questions about ease of use and willingness to use the layout
- This was redundant since the experiment already has a **UMUX questionnaire** at the end that measures satisfaction

## Between-Subjects Design Clarification

**Current Design**:
- Each participant is assigned to ONE group (A or B)
- Group A: Overlay layout ONLY (baseline)
- Group B: Small multiples layout ONLY (treatment)
- Participants complete 6 tasks with their assigned layout
- NO layout switching, NO breaks between blocks
- Only ONE test block per participant

**Questionnaires**:
- ~~Post-block satisfaction~~ (REMOVED - was asking 2 questions after tasks)
- **UMUX questionnaire** (KEPT - comprehensive satisfaction measurement)

## Changes Made

### 1. TestBlock Component (`src/components/steps/TestBlock.tsx`)

**Removed**:
- `showQuestionnaire` state variable
- `addSatisfactionResponse` from context import
- `handleQuestionnaireSubmit` function
- `handleQuestionnaireSkip` function
- Conditional rendering of SatisfactionQuestionnaire component
- SatisfactionQuestionnaire import

**Updated**:
- Flow now goes directly from last task → `onComplete()` → UMUX questionnaire
- Removed conditional `{!showQuestionnaire ? ... : ...}` logic
- Updated component documentation to reflect between-subjects design

**Before Flow**:
```
Tasks 1-6 → Post-Block Satisfaction (2 questions) → UMUX → Completion
```

**After Flow**:
```
Tasks 1-6 → UMUX → Completion
```

### 2. ExperimentCompletion Component (`src/components/ExperimentCompletion.tsx`)

**Removed**:
- `getSatisfactionResponses` from context import
- `clearSatisfactionResponses` from context import
- `satisfactionResponses` local variable
- References to `blocksCompleted` in completion summary
- "Blocks Completed" and "Satisfaction Ratings" UI rows

**Updated**:
- Firebase sync now passes empty array for `satisfactionResponses: []`
- Data export now passes empty array for satisfaction responses
- Completion summary now shows:
  - Tasks Completed: 6/6
  - Correct Answers: X (Y%)
  - UMUX Questionnaire: Completed/Incomplete
- Group display changed from "Overlay First" to "Overlay Layout" (no "First" since there's only one layout)
- Validation warnings updated to check for UMUX response instead of blocks
- Reset dialog updated to mention UMUX instead of satisfaction ratings

### 3. Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/components/steps/TestBlock.tsx` - Removed satisfaction questionnaire logic
2. ✅ `src/components/ExperimentCompletion.tsx` - Updated to reflect single test block with UMUX only

### 4. Files NOT Modified (intentionally)

- `src/components/SatisfactionQuestionnaire.tsx` - Component still exists but is no longer used (can be deleted later if needed)
- `src/contexts/VisualizationContext.tsx` - Still has `addSatisfactionResponse` and `getSatisfactionResponses` functions but they're not called

## Current Experiment Flow

1. **Welcome Screen** - Participant ID and group assignment displayed
2. **Demographics Form** - Age, education, chart experience, environmental background
3. **Instructions Screen** - Task instructions and layout explanation
4. **Test Block** - 6 tasks with assigned layout (overlay OR small multiples)
5. **UMUX Questionnaire** - 4-item satisfaction questionnaire
6. **Completion Screen** - Data summary and export

## Data Saved to Firebase

```javascript
{
  participantId: "uuid",
  assignedGroup: "A" or "B",
  demographics: {
    age: "25",
    education: "Bachelor's Degree",
    chartExperience: "Moderate",
    environmentalBackground: "No"
  },
  taskResponses: [
    // 6 task responses with metrics
  ],
  satisfactionResponses: [], // Empty array (no post-block satisfaction)
  umuxResponse: {
    q1_capabilities: 7,
    q2_ease: 6,
    q3_learning: 7,
    q4_efficient: 6,
    umuxScore: 80.83
  },
  finalPreference: {
    // Same as umuxResponse
  },
  timestamp: Firestore.Timestamp
}
```

## Benefits of This Change

1. ✅ **Clearer Design** - Between-subjects design is now properly implemented without confusing block-level satisfaction
2. ✅ **Reduced Redundancy** - UMUX provides comprehensive satisfaction measurement, no need for additional questions
3. ✅ **Shorter Experiment** - Participants complete experiment faster (2 fewer questions)
4. ✅ **Better Data Quality** - Single comprehensive satisfaction measurement (UMUX) is more reliable than multiple short questionnaires
5. ✅ **Simplified Analysis** - Only need to analyze UMUX scores for satisfaction, not multiple satisfaction measures

## Testing

To verify the changes work correctly:

1. Start a new experiment session: http://localhost:5173/
2. Complete demographics form
3. Complete all 6 tasks
4. Verify you proceed DIRECTLY to UMUX questionnaire (no post-block satisfaction)
5. Complete UMUX questionnaire
6. Check completion screen shows:
   - Tasks Completed: 6/6
   - UMUX Questionnaire: Completed
   - NO "Blocks Completed" or "Satisfaction Ratings" rows
7. Download data and verify `satisfactionResponses` is an empty array

## Firebase Security Rules

**Reminder**: Update Firestore security rules to allow writes:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /participants/{participantId} {
      allow create: if true;  // Allow creating new participant records
      allow read: if false;   // Prevent reading other participants' data
      allow update, delete: if false;  // Prevent modifications
    }
  }
}
```

## Notes for Thesis Documentation

When documenting this in your thesis:

1. **Clarify Design**: "A between-subjects design was employed where each participant was assigned to one of two conditions (overlay or small multiples layout) and completed all tasks using only their assigned layout."

2. **Satisfaction Measurement**: "User satisfaction was measured using the standardized UMUX (Usability Metric for User Experience) questionnaire administered after task completion."

3. **Data Collection**: "The study collected effectiveness metrics (task accuracy), efficiency metrics (completion time, interaction patterns), and satisfaction metrics (UMUX scores) for each participant."

## Cleanup Tasks (Optional)

If you want to fully remove the satisfaction questionnaire code:

1. Delete `src/components/SatisfactionQuestionnaire.tsx`
2. Remove `addSatisfactionResponse` and `getSatisfactionResponses` from VisualizationContext
3. Remove `satisfactionResponses` from localStorage state

However, keeping the code (even if unused) won't cause any issues and may be useful if you decide to add post-task satisfaction ratings in the future.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Impact**: Experiment flow now correctly implements between-subjects design with single satisfaction measurement (UMUX)
